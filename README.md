# Breez SDK

## Overview
The Breez SDK enables developers to integrate Lightning and bitcoin payments into their apps with a very shallow learning curve. The use cases are endless – from social apps that want to integrate tipping between users to content-creation apps interested in adding bitcoin monetization. Crucially, this SDK is an end-to-end, non-custodial, drop-in solution powered by Greenlight, a built-in LSP, on-chain interoperability, third-party fiat on-ramps, and other services users and operators need. The Breez SDK is free for developers.
   
The Breez SDK provides the following services:
* Sending payments (via various protocols such as: bolt11, keysend, lnurl-pay, lightning address, etc.)
* Receiving payments (via various protocols such as: bolt11, lnurl-withdraw, etc.)
* Fetching node status (e.g. balance, max allow to pay, max allow to receive, on-chain balance, etc.)
* Connecting to a new or existing node.

## Command line
[Breez sdk-cli](https://github.com/breez/breez-sdk/tree/main/tools/sdk-cli) is a command line client that allows you to test the functionality of the Breez SDK.

## Build & Test
The libs folder contains three sub folders and is a structured as a cargo workspace:
* **sdk-core**: the core SDK rust library. 
* **sdk-bindings**: ffi bindings for Kotlin, Python, Swift, C# and Go. 
* **sdk-flutter**: a flutter plugin (includes ffi bindings for dart).
* **sdk-react-native**: a react-native plugin.

The tools folder contains a simple command line interface (sdk-cli) to the SDK.
See the instructions in each sub project readme on how to build, test and run.
