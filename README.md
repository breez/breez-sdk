# Breez SDK

## Overview
The Breez SDK enables mobile developers to integrate Lightning and bitcoin payments into their apps with a very shallow learning curve. The use cases are endless – from social apps that want to integrate tipping between users to content-creation apps interested in adding bitcoin monetization. Crucially, this SDK is an end-to-end, non-custodial, drop-in solution powered by Greenlight, a built-in LSP, on-chain interoperability, third-party fiat on-ramps, and other services users and operators need.
   
The Breez SDK provides the following services:
* Sending payments (via various protocols such as: bolt11, keysend, lnurl-pay, lightning address, etc.)
* Receiving payments (via various protocols such as: bolt11, lnurl-withdraw, etc.)
* Fetching node status (e.g. balance, max allow to pay, max allow to receive, on-chain balance, etc.)
* Connecting to a new or existing node.

## Architechture
This diagram is a high-level description of the Breez SDK:

### Signer
This module handles everything related to the signing of lightning messages. It is initialized with the user’s seed.
### InputParser
This module parses user input that is related to sending and receiving of payments. It identifies the protocol (lightning, lnurl-pay, lightning address, lnurl-withdraw, btc address, etc.) and the related data. Apps should use this parser to interpret users input, display the details to users and then execute the specific action (pay or receive).
### LightningNode
This is an interface that defines how the SDK interacts with the user’s Lightning node. The interface defines methods to create a new node, connect to an existing node, pay or create invoices. It also provides access to the node’s low-level functionality such as: listing peers, graph information etc. Currently we only have one provider (Greenlight) but we can add more providers in the future.
### BTCSwapper
This module provides the ability to send or receive on-chain payments via submarine swaps. Send to a BTC address is done by a reverse submarine swap and receive by a regular submarine swap. It includes refund functionality as well.
### FiatCurrencies
This module provides fiat currencies conversion services and fiat on-ramp service (via MoonPay).
### LSP
This module provides the interface of interacting with one or more LSPs.

## Build & Test
The libs folder contains three sub folders and is a structured as a cargo workspace:
* **sdk-core**: the core SDK rust library. 
* **sdk-bindings**: ffi bindings for Kotlin & Swift. 
* **sdk-flutter**: a flutter plugin (includes ffi bindings for dart).
* **sdk-react-native**: a react-native plugin.

The tools folder contains a simple command line interface (sdk-cli) to the SDK
See instruction in each sub project readme on how to build, test and run.

Remark: in order to build the Breez SDK you need to have access to the Greenlight repository. Greenlight will eventually be open-sourced (with an MIT license), but is not yet public. To access Greenlight, please email us at contact@breez.technology.
